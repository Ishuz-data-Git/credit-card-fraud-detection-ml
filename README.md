# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques on a highly imbalanced dataset.

The goal is to identify fraud cases accurately while minimizing false negatives.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to normal transactions, making accuracy a misleading metric.  
The main objective is to maximize *Recall* for fraud detection to reduce financial loss.

---

## 💼 Business Impact

- Early detection of fraudulent transactions
- Helps reduce financial losses
- Demonstrates handling of imbalanced datasets using threshold tuning

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Loading & Exploration  
2. Data Cleaning  
3. Feature Scaling  
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression)  
5. Threshold Tuning  
6. Model Evaluation  

---

## 📊 Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~99.9%
- Precision (Fraud): ~74%
- Recall (Fraud): ~71%
- F1-Score (Fraud): ~73%
---
 Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, Recall was prioritized over Accuracy to ensure maximum fraud detection.
