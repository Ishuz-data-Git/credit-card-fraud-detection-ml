# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques on a highly imbalanced dataset.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Fraudulent transactions are very rare compared to normal transactions, making accuracy a misleading metric.
The main goal is to **maximize recall for fraud cases** to reduce financial loss.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading & Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Scaling
4. Logistic Regression Model
5. Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
6. Threshold Tuning to Improve Recall

## 📊 Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~99.9%
- Precision (Fraud): ~74%
- Recall (Fraud): ~71%
- F1-Score (Fraud): ~73%

> Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, **recall is prioritized over accuracy**.

## 📈 Key Learning
- Accuracy is not reliable for imbalanced datasets
- Recall is the most important metric in fraud detection
- Threshold tuning helps capture more fraudulent transactions

## 📂 Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Dataset (European cardholders)
